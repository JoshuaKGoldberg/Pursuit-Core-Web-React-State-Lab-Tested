Build a simple clicker game. It should have the following requirements:

- Display the current score to the user
- Clicking a button increments the score by one
- Have a button where the user can spend points to increase the value of each click
- Display an `alert` with the text `You can't afford that!` if the user doesn't have enough points to spend
- When the user has 100 points, display a victory screen
- Have a button that resets the game
